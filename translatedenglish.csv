Without realizing who was sitting under it, he continued his speech by talking about how one of his listeners happened, but before trying to repeat. In his words, I will describe the head of these, whom he seemed to want to impress mainly. A woman of a few years enjoyed the most exquisite beauty that her golden hair floated in curls on her shoulders, and her shining eyes were shaded. the heavy eyelids and her mouth, the parted lips seemed to breathe sensibility But she seemed pensive unhappy, her cheek was pale, she seemed as if she was used to suffering and as if the lessons she heard were the only words of wisdom that she had heard. His face looked very different, his form was almost emaciated in the shade, his features were beautiful but thin and bright, his eyes shone as if they were animating the face of decay. his forehead was expansive, but there was a doubt of perplexity in his aspect that seemed to say that, although he had sought wisdom, he had become entangled in mysterious labyrinths of which he struggled in vain to free himself. While Diotima spoke, his color came with rapid changes. the flexible muscles of his face showed every impression that his mind received, it seemed someone who in life had studied a lot, but whose weak frame sank under the weight of the mere effort of life, the spark of intelligence burned with extraordinary strength inside him, but that of life. it seemed never on the eve of vanishing At this moment I will not describe any other of this group, but with deep attention, I try to remember in my memory some of Diotima&#39;s words that were words of fire, but his path is slightly marked in my memory It requires a fair hand, she said, continuing her speech, to weigh up dividing the good from the bad. On earth they are inextricably entangled and if they discard what is there. An evil appears A multitude of beneficial causes or effects cling to it Teases your work When I was on earth and walked in a lonely country during the silence of the night, I saw the multitude of stars, the soft glow of the moon reflected in the sea. , which was studded with beautiful islands When I felt the soft breeze glide down my cheek while the words of love that calmed me encouraged me, my mind almost seemed to leave the body that limited it to the earth with a quick mental sense to mingle with the scene that I barely saw Then I exclaimed, oh world, how beautiful you are. Oh brighter universe, contemplate your worshiper spirit of beauty of sympathy that pervades all things, now raise my soul like wings, how have you encouraged the light? the breezes Deep inexplicable spirit give me words to express my adoration; My mind rushes, but with language I can not say how I feel your kindness. The silence or the song of the nightingale, the momentary appearance of a bird that flies silently, everything seems animated with you more than all the deep sky full of worlds &quot;If the winds roared in the sea and the frightful lightning seemed to fall around me still Love mingled with the sacred terror I felt, the majesty of beauty deeply impressed me, so I also felt when I saw a lovely face or heard solemn music or the eloquence of divine wisdom that flows from the lips of one of his worshipers, a charming animal or even the graceful undulations of trees in inanimate objects, has awakened in me the same deep feeling of love beauty, a feeling that, although it made me alive, anxious to look for the animating cause of the scene, but I was satisfied with its depth, as if I had already found the solution to my questions, as if feeling part of the great everything I had found. The universe of the universe But when I retired in my cell, I studied, I have contemplated the various movements and actions in the world, the weight of evil has confused me. If I thought about creation, I saw an eternal chain of evil united from the other to the great. The whale that swallows in the sea destroys crowds. The smaller fish that live in it also torment him and drive him crazy to the cat whose pleasure is to torment his prey. I saw the whole creation full of pain that each creature seems to exist through the misery of another death. chaos is the slogan of the animated world.
